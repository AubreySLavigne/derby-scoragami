# Roller Derby Scoragami

Identifies unique Roller Derby Scores

## Questions

### What is 'Scoragami'?

Scoragami is a term created by SB Nation director Jon Bois to describe a the
first time a given final score has happened. Due to American Football's irregular
scoring (6 points for touchdowns, 3 points for field goals, 2 points for
safeties, etc.), certain scores are difficult due the specific circumstances
needed to arrive at that score.

https://nflscorigami.com/ has more details about how this applies to the NFL.

### What is this project?

I decided to apply this concept to Roller Derby Scores.  FlatTrackStats.com
allows users to download a snapshot of their database, which means that we
would have access to scores as early as 2003 (around the modern conception of
the sport)

### Why do this?

Because I felt like it.
